library: OpenGV

brief:   OpenGV is a collection of computer vision methods for solving
         geometric vision problems. It contains absolute-pose, relative-pose,
         triangulation, and point-cloud alignment methods for the calibrated
         case. All problems can be solved with central or non-central cameras,
         and embedded into a random sample consensus or nonlinear optimization
         context. Matlab and Python interfaces are implemented as well. The link
         to the above pages also shows links to precompiled Matlab mex-libraries.
         Please consult the documentation for more information.
